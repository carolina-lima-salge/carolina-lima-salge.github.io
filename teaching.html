    <h1>Teaching</h1>
    <div class="article-wrap">
    <h4>My teaching record at the University of Georgia</h4>
     <p style="text-align:justify">The first course I ever taught in the 
     <a href="http://www.terry.uga.edu/mis/">Department of MIS</a> was <b>Data Management (MIST 4610)</b> in the Fall of 2014. 
     This course provides a basic understanding of information management in organizations and specifically 
     the design and use of database systems. Topics include data modeling, relational databases, structured query language, 
     and Web access to databases. The course is divided into three sections: (1) information management concepts and 
     procedures for Web-based systems; (2) data modeling and database design; (3) data analytics; (4) data management. 
     I have taught Data Management five different times and my average rating, as indicated below, is 4.55:</p>
    
    <p style="text-align:justify">The only other course I taught here was <b>Business Intelligence (MIST 5620)</b>, this time in the Fall of 2016. 
     This course provides the skills necessary to conceptualize, build, and implement systems utilizing business intelligence in 
     organizations. Topics include big data, executive information systems, dashboards and scorecards, machine learning, text mining, 
     and mapReduce. The course is divided into two sections: (1) descriptive and (2) predictive analytics.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align:center"><i>Fall 2016 (4.82/5.0)</i></p>
    
    <p style="text-align:justify">For all six courses, I was responsible for the entire portion of the classes, 
     including developing and scheduling lectures, exams, assignments, and grading.</p> 
    
    <h4>Philosophy on SQL and R for IS</h4>
     <p style="text-align:justify">Students are often misinformed or even frightened about technical courses in 
     information systems (IS). Before class, you hear the murmurs: "No fun." "Boring." "I'm not going to be a programmer – 
     I don’t need this course." "I'm scared I'll never get this and I'll ruin my GPA." 
     As a former student-athlete, I thought many of the same things about practice and drills – 
     the technical aspects of my sport. However, it was the passion, knowledge and caring of my coaches that 
     fired my imagination and honed my work ethic. It is this legacy that informs my teaching and research 
     and drives me to engage students to overcome their misconceptions about technical subjects and classes.</p>
     
     <p style="text-align:justify">My primary goal as a teacher is to reveal 
     Structured Query Language (SQL) and R Programming as exciting endeavors both relevant and fun. 
     Furthermore, I help students to see how coding is important to their professional careers and can sharpen their 
     logical thinking, improving their problem solving abilities. Accordingly, the overarching objectives for my students 
     are that they develop a basic understanding of information management in organizations, specifically the design and 
     use of relational database systems, that they feel motivated to continue with their technical exploration, and 
     that they recognize that presenting well in a public environment influences how much their audience will absorb 
     the knowledge that they communicate. Additionally, I teach with the intention that students should be able to 
     reconcile their technical skills with information problems faced by organizations.</p>
     
     <p style="text-align:center"><i>1. Students should understand the organizational issues involved in data management</i></p>
     
    <p style="text-align:justify">My first objective is to influence students to be well-rounded citizens when it comes to 
    business knowledge. Without a general understanding of the process to which data are created, stored, and analyzed, 
    students are ill prepared to solve problems at the organizational level. In my class, I promote business literacy 
    by exemplifying general concepts with up to date and specific examples that students can relate to, motivating 
    in-class discussions, and developing group projects in which students gain first-hand experience with 
    methodologies and concepts used by data managers. The different approaches allow me to vary the pace of the class, 
    attend to a variety of learning styles, and as a result, stimulate student interest.</p>
     
	 <p style="text-align:center"><i>2. Students should be able to build and use a relational database</i></p>
     
    <p style="text-align:justify">No student should complete a course in data management without developing an 
    understanding of these core concepts. To accomplish this, I spend effort in presenting the material in a clear 
    and engaging manner, expecting students to extrapolate their knowledge to solve problems using the core 
    foundations taught in class. MIS students should understand that no technical skill exists in a vacuum; 
    relating technical concepts to business actually aids in solving organizational problems.</p>
    
 <p style="text-align:center"><i>3. Students should be inspired and retain what they have learned to possibly continue with their technical exploration</i></p>
     
    <p style="text-align:justify">My next objective is imbedded in my belief that coding interest is significant to enjoying 
    a successful career in IS. I therefore expect students to be engaged in the course material and to spend significant 
    time in their group projects. Data management is inherently an interesting sub-field in information systems and I find 
    that enthusiasm when combined with preparation, from my part, can inspire students to show interest and commitment to 
    the class. When students participate in a class that they truly enjoy they are more likely to retain the knowledge that 
    they gain.</p>
    
  <p style="text-align:center"><i>4. Students should develop professional presentation skills which can help them communicate their newly gained knowledge and enthusiasm in my class and beyond</i></p>
     
    <p style="text-align:justify">Any student will struggle if they are not able to effectively communicate their knowledge 
    in a business environment. The ability to publicly present a topic is particularly important for consultants. 
    To accommodate this need, I require my students to present on a data management technology or product as group, 
    with a particular concentration on open source products. The goal is for students to explain what the technology is, 
    how it has been used which includes its pros and cons, and to discuss the future of the technology.</p>
